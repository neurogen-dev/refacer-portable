# Refacer: One-Click Deepfake Multi-Face Swap Tool - Portable version 

## What's different in this build:

- Added support for ESRGAN and GFPGAN from [this PR](https://github.com/xaviviro/refacer/pull/50)

- You can set the number of GPU threads via the gpu-threads command line argument. 

- You can set the number of frames to process per batch via the frame_limit command line argument (instead of default 1000 frames).

- You can enable TensorRT acceleration via the tensorrt command line argument (EXPERIMENTAL).

Additionally, this portable build uses the latest CUDNN (8.9.4).
